Email Validation: Regex for Dummies

The following tutorial is meant to help guide you into Regular Expressions. In JavaScript, regular expression are patturns used to match character combinations in strings. Several components define the building blocks to which we'll break down and evaluate in greater detail.

## Summary

Today I'll be walking through an indepth description and tutorial of regular expressions (RegEx), specifically we'll be creating an email regex. The following regular expression below is used to verify the validation of email address inputs that are submitted by the user. 

Email â€“ /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

We'll begin by discussing anchors, which are used to match a position before or after characters.

Use the ^ anchor to match the beginning of the text.
Use the $ anchor to match the end of the text.
Use the m flag to enable the multiline mode that instructs the ^ and $ anchors to match the beginning and end of the text as well as the beginning and end of the line.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. The following table lists the quantifiers supported by .NET.

QUANTIFIERS IN REGULAR EXPRESSIONS: There are different types of qualifiers, which are either defined as a "greedy qualifier" or "lazy qualifier". Below are the various versions that could be seen in regular expressions.  

*	Match zero or more times.
+	Match one or more times.
?	Match zero or one time.
{ n }	Match exactly n times.
{ n ,}	Match at least n times.
{ n , m }	Match from n to m times.

For email validation, we use the qualifiers + and {}.
